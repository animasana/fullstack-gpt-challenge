      "According to the context provided, Winston believes that Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford are guilty of the crimes they are charged with, even though he reflects that he had seen a photograph that disproved their guilt. However, he dismisses the memory of the photograph as something he invented, indicating that he has come to accept the Party's version of reality. Therefore, within the narrative, the guilt of Aaronson (and the others) is accepted as a fact by Winston, even if it is known to be false.\n"
